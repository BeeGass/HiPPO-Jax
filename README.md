TODO: Change banners from pathML's to VS4's

This repo implements and benchmarks a number of drop-in replacements for attention:

- HiPPO
- S4

The data we used to benchmark this is:

- [Cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- [Camelyon17](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/)
- [TIGER](https://tiger.grand-challenge.org/)

**View [documentation](https://pathml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

:construction: the `dev` branch is under active development, with experimental features, bug fixes, and refactors that may happen at any time!
Stable versions are available as tagged releases on GitHub, or as versioned releases on PyPI
